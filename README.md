# Crud API with Node.js and Docker
This is from a tutorial I followed from Francesco Ciulla on dev.to. This app has Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality. This app can be tested with Postman or any other
Api testing application you like. You must have Docker installed to use this as the database is maintained on a container.
